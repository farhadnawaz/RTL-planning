## Paper
Farhad Nawaz, Shaoting Peng, Lars Lindemann, Nadia Figueroa, Nikolai Matni, "Reactive Temporal Logic-based Planning and Control for Interactive Robotic Tasks", _arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.19594_, 2024. (available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00186](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19594)). 

**TL;DR**: We build a discrete task planner (200 Hz) and a continuous motion planner (1 KHz) for reactive time-critical tasks and complex periodic motions. Project webpage: [https://sites.google.com/view/lfd-neural-ode/home](https://sites.google.com/view/rtl-plan-control-hri/home)
